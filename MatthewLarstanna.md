## What I Learned
I learned GitHub is a cloud based application which lets people collaborate on coding projects.
Users create their own repositories, which contain the files for a project.
Repositories may be shared with others so multiple people can work on the project.
You can use branches to safely experiement changes without affecting the orginal repository.
Alternatively, you can create a fork to copy another user's repository and play with your own version.

## What I Don't Understand
I know commit and push is how you submit changes, but what's the difference?
